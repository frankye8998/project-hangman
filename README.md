# Project Hangman

Hangman, but made by Frank.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get hangman running on your machine.

### Installing

```
$ git clone https://github.com/frankye8998/project-hangman
$ cd project-hangman
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, you may use the [ZIP download link](https://github.com/frankye8998/project-hangman/archive/master.zip).

### Setting up word lists

You may add wordlists in the `settings.json` file. Local wordlists automatically detect CSV files and default to separating words by newlines (`\n`). Spaces in delimiters are notated with `<space>` in local wordlists only. Please refer to the pre-installed wordlists provided.
